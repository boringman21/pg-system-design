## üéØ Typical Startup Interview Questions

### **1. Design an MVP Social Media App**
**Scenario**: Early-stage startup, 3-person team, $5K/month budget

**Requirements**:
- User registration & authentication
- Post text updates (500 chars max)
- Follow other users
- Basic timeline
- Handle 1K daily active users initially

**Startup Considerations**:
```python
# MVP Approach
- Use managed services (Firebase, Supabase)
- Single database (PostgreSQL)
- Simple caching (Redis)
- Basic CDN (Cloudflare)
- Deploy on single region

# Cost Optimization
- Serverless functions for API
- Shared database instances
- Free tier services when possible
- Monitor spending closely
```

**Evolution Path**:
- **Week 1-2**: Basic auth + posting
- **Month 1**: Timeline generation
- **Month 3**: Search functionality
- **Month 6**: Scale to 10K users

### **2. Design a Food Delivery Platform**
**Scenario**: Series A startup, 8-person team, competing with DoorDash

**Requirements**:
- Restaurant onboarding
- Menu management
- Order placement & tracking
- Driver allocation
- Payment processing
- Start with 100 restaurants, 500 daily orders

**Startup Constraints**:
```python
# Resource Limitations
- Cannot build everything from scratch
- Use third-party APIs (Stripe, Google Maps)
- Focus on core differentiator
- Rapid iteration based on feedback

# Architecture Decisions
- Monolith initially (faster development)
- Break into services when team grows
- Use existing payment solutions
- Leverage mapping APIs
```

### **3. Design a SaaS Analytics Dashboard**
**Scenario**: B2B startup, targeting small businesses

**Requirements**:
- Connect to multiple data sources
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Custom report generation
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Support 100 companies, 1K users each

**Startup Approach**:
```python
# Multi-tenancy Strategy
- Shared database with tenant isolation
- Per-tenant data encryption
- Resource quotas per plan
- Horizontal scaling preparation

# Data Pipeline
- Start with batch processing
- Add real-time as customers demand
- Use existing connectors (Zapier, etc.)
- Focus on core metrics first
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Startup-Specific Design Patterns

### **1. Progressive Architecture**
Start simple, scale incrementally:

```python
# Phase 1: MVP (Month 1-3)
[Frontend] ‚Üí [API Gateway] ‚Üí [Monolith] ‚Üí [PostgreSQL]
                                ‚Üì
                           [Redis Cache]

# Phase 2: Growth (Month 4-12)
[Frontend] ‚Üí [Load Balancer] ‚Üí [API Gateway]
                                    ‚Üì
[User Service] ‚Üê [Order Service] ‚Üê [Payment Service]
      ‚Üì              ‚Üì                  ‚Üì
[User DB]      [Order DB]        [Payment API]

# Phase 3: Scale (Year 2+)
[CDN] ‚Üí [Frontend] ‚Üí [API Gateway] ‚Üí [Microservices]
                           ‚Üì              ‚Üì
                    [Message Queue] ‚Üí [Background Jobs]
```

### **2. Cost-Optimized Tech Stack**
```python
# Startup-Friendly Stack
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js (free hosting on Vercel)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Python (familiar to most devs)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (cost-effective)
- **Cache**: Redis (simple, powerful)
- **Search**: Elasticsearch (open source)
- **Queue**: Redis/SQS (managed service)
- **Monitoring**: DataDog/New Relic (startup discounts)
- **CDN**: Cloudflare (generous free tier)
```

### **3. Build vs Buy Decisions**
```python
# Always BUY (don't build):
- Authentication (Auth0, Firebase Auth)
- Payment processing (Stripe, PayPal)
- Email service (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- SMS/Push notifications (Twilio, FCM)
- Analytics (Mixpanel, Amplitude)

# Consider BUILDING:
- Core business logic
- Unique algorithms/features
- Simple CRUD operations
- Basic search functionality

# BUILD when you have resources:
- Advanced recommendation engines
- Complex workflow systems
- Custom security requirements
```

## üé≠ Common Interview Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Resource Constraints**
**Question**: "Your startup has $10K/month budget and 2 engineers. Design Instagram."

**Approach**:
1. **MVP Features**: Photo upload, basic feed, likes
2. **Tech Stack**: Serverless + managed services
3. **Cost Management**: Use free tiers, monitor spending
4. **Scaling Plan**: Clear migration path to more robust solution

### **Scenario 2: Rapid Scaling**
**Question**: "Your app went viral. Users grew from 1K to 100K in 2 weeks. What do you do?"

**Approach**:
1. **Immediate Actions**: Scale current infrastructure
2. **Bottleneck Identification**: Database, API, frontend
3. **Quick Fixes**: Caching, CDN, load balancing
4. **Long-term Plan**: Architecture redesign if needed

### **Scenario 3: Limited Technical Expertise**
**Question**: "Your team has 1 senior engineer and 2 junior developers. Design a complex system."

**Approach**:
1. **Simplify Architecture**: Avoid over-engineering
2. **Use Managed Services**: Reduce operational complexity
3. **Clear Documentation**: Enable junior developers
4. **Gradual Complexity**: Add features incrementally

## üí∞ Cost-Aware Design Principles

### **1. Start Small, Think Big**
```python
# Design Pattern
class StartupArchitecture:
    def design_system(self, requirements):
        # Phase 1: MVP with minimal cost
        mvp_design = self.create_mvp(requirements)
        
        # Phase 2: Plan for 10x growth
        growth_plan = self.plan_scaling(mvp_design)
        
        # Phase 3: Consider eventual complexity
        future_architecture = self.design_future_state()
        
        return {
            'mvp': mvp_design,
            'growth': growth_plan,
            'future': future_architecture
        }
```

### **2. Leverage Free Tiers**
```python
# Startup Budget Optimization
monthly_budget = 5000  # $5K/month

# Free tier utilization
free_services = {
    'vercel': 'Frontend hosting',
    'planetscale': 'Database (5GB free)',
    'cloudflare': 'CDN + DDoS protection',
    'github_actions': 'CI/CD (2000 min/month)',
    'google_cloud': '$300 credit for new accounts'
}

# Paid essentials
paid_services = {
    'heroku': '$25/month for API hosting',
    'redis_cloud': '$30/month for caching',
    'sendgrid': '$20/month for emails',
    'stripe': '2.9% + 30¬¢ per transaction'
}
```

### **3. Technical Debt Management**
```python
# Startup Technical Debt Strategy
class TechnicalDebtStrategy:
    def evaluate_debt(self, feature):
        # Quick and dirty for MVP features
        if feature.is_mvp_critical:
            return "ship_fast"
        
        # Proper implementation for core features
        if feature.is_core_business_logic:
            return "build_right"
        
        # Use existing solutions for non-core
        if feature.is_commodity:
            return "buy_solution"
```
